# 🏥 MediChain

### Decentralized Prescription Verification & Medicine Tracking System

MediChain is a blockchain-powered healthcare platform that enables secure prescription management, medicine verification, and government auditing through decentralized technologies.

The platform integrates DigiLocker-based identity verification, Polygon blockchain, IPFS storage, and role-based dashboards to create a transparent and tamper-proof healthcare ecosystem.

# 🚀 Problem Statement

Healthcare systems face several challenges:

* Fake and forged prescriptions
* Prescription reuse and abuse
* Lack of medicine traceability
* Counterfeit drug circulation
* Limited government audit capabilities
* Fragmented healthcare records

MediChain solves these problems by creating an immutable and verifiable prescription lifecycle using blockchain technology.

---

# 💡 Solution

MediChain provides a decentralized healthcare infrastructure where:

1. Citizens authenticate using DigiLocker.
2. Doctors create digital prescriptions.
3. Prescriptions are stored on IPFS.
4. IPFS hashes are recorded on Polygon Blockchain.
5. Pharmacies verify prescriptions before dispensing medicines.
6. Government regulators can audit all transactions in real time.

Every action is recorded on-chain, ensuring transparency and accountability.
